Cog / PLACTAC / TD / MOV Annotation Rules  
Authoritative Guide (with Cog5 and CogSlide)

0. Scope and Purpose  
This system annotates object-centred semantics in descriptive and technical texts. Annotation is descriptive, minimal, and surface-bound. No interpretive, causal, or explanatory enrichment is permitted beyond what is linguistically present.  
The aim is to track: objects; their parts and products; their properties and states; their environments; and human interventions upon them; while allowing controlled shifts of semantic focus.

1. Core Principles (Non-negotiable)  
1.1 Surface fidelity  
Annotate only what is explicitly present in the text. Do not infer functions, causes, purposes, or intentions unless lexically stated.  

1.2 Minimal sufficiency  
Use the fewest annotations required to preserve semantic structure. Absence of annotation is often the correct choice.  

1.3 One label per token/phrase  
A token or phrase receives only one Cog / PLACTAC / TD / MOV label.  

1.4 Object primacy  
The system is organised around objects, not events, discourse roles, or argument structure.

2. Cog Inventory (Updated)

2.1 Cog1 - Primary Object (Current Centre)  
An object that is the current centre of attention in the sentence or clause. Typically: a tree, plant, artefact, substance, or organism. There may be multiple Cog1s in a sentence if explicitly coordinated.  
Example: ?Cog1: oak?, ?Cog1: maple?

2.2 Cog1Ref - Reference Object  
An object mentioned for comparison, resemblance, or analogy. Never the centre of description.  
Example: "like ?Cog1Ref: chestnut?"

2.3 Cog2p - Property  
Stable or characteristic properties of an object. Includes shape, colour, texture, size, disposition, quality.  
Example: ?Cog2p: smooth?, ?Cog2p: hard?, ?Cog2p: vigorous?

2.4 Cog2t - Transient State  
Temporary, time-bound, or processual conditions. Used sparingly.  
Example: ?Cog2t: unripe?, ?Cog2t: hollowing?

2.5 Cog3Int - Intrinsic Part  
Physical parts that belong structurally to an object.  
Example: ?Cog3Int: leaf?, ?Cog3Int: bark?, ?Cog3Int: root?

2.6 Cog3Der - Derived Product  
Products or substances produced by an object, but not structural parts.  
Example: ?Cog3Der: wood?, ?Cog3Der: resin?, ?Cog3Der: charcoal?

2.7 Cog4 - Environment / Provenance / Group  
Geographic regions, habitats, peoples, provenance labels.  
Example: ?Cog4: mountains?, ?Cog4: Arcadians?, ?Cog4: plains?

2.8 Cog5 - Secondary Independent Object (Definition)  
Cog5 marks an independent object which: (i) is not the current centre of attention, but (ii) affects or is affected by the Cog1 object in the local context. Cog5 is not a property, part, or product.  
Typical cases: interacting organisms; tools; animals; humans; natural agents acting upon the main object; recipients or targets of an effect.  
Example patterns: animals eating leaves; humans using wood; wind breaking a tree; fire acting on timber.  
Examples:  
?Cog1: oak? ... eaten by ?Cog5: goats?  
?Cog5: fire? burns ?Cog1: wood?  
Rules:  
- Cog5 must be ontologically independent.  
- Cog5 must have explicit interaction in the sentence.  
- Do not use Cog5 for abstract concepts or discourse roles.

3. CogSlide - Shift of Centre of Attention

3.1 Definition  
CogSlide is a rule-governed promotion of an object to Cog1 status when the text shifts its descriptive centre. An object that was previously Cog3Int, Cog3Der, or Cog5 may become Cog1 in a new sentence or clause if it becomes the primary object described. This reflects a shift of semantic focus, not a change in ontology.

3.2 CogSlide Rules  
Locality: CogSlide operates only across sentence or clause boundaries, not mid-phrase.  
Explicit focus: the promoted object must now receive properties, parts, actions, or extended description.  
No retroactive change: previous annotations remain valid; promotion does not rewrite earlier Cog assignments.  
No marking: CogSlide is not tagged explicitly; it is inferred from the change in Cog role.

3.3 Example  
Sentence 1: ?Cog1: oak? produces ?Cog3Der: wood?.  
Sentence 2: ?Cog1: wood? is hard and durable.  
Here, wood undergoes CogSlide from Cog3Der ? Cog1.

4. PLACTAC - Human Operations

4.1 Purpose  
PLACTAC annotations mark explicit human actions performed on objects.

4.2 PLACTAC_STEP  
Concrete, named operations.  
Examples: ?PLACTAC_STEP: cutting?; ?PLACTAC_STEP: building-use?; ?PLACTAC_STEP: selling?

4.3 Rules  
Annotate only actions explicitly expressed.  
Do not infer human agency unless named.  
Do not attach PLACTAC to abstract verbs.

5. TD - Temporal Designators

5.1 Purpose  
TD marks explicit time expressions that anchor a description, state, or operation in time.

5.2 Inventory  
TD_ABS - Absolute time anchor (calendar/dated reference).  
Examples: "on 12 Pharmouthi", "in year 5", "on the third day of the month".  
TD_REL - Relative / seasonal / sequential anchor.  
Examples: "in winter", "afterwards", "at first", "then", "formerly", "now".  
TD_DUR - Duration.  
Examples: "for three days", "during a month", "for a long time" (if explicitly stated).

5.3 Rules  
Annotate only overt time expressions; do not infer timing from aspect, world knowledge, or narrative logic.  
Prefer the minimal time phrase; do not tag extra surrounding material.  
Do not tag frequency or degree adverbs unless they function as a time anchor in the clause (default: leave unannotated).  
One label per token/phrase: TD does not co-attach with Cog or PLACTAC.

6. MOV - Movement / Transfer Anchors

6.1 Purpose  
MOV marks explicit source, destination, and path for movement/transfer of an object.

6.2 Inventory  
MOV_SRC - Source ("from X").  
MOV_DST - Destination ("to/into X").  
MOV_PATH - Route/medium ("through/by way of X", "along X", "by sea/river/road").

6.3 Rules  
Annotate only when movement/transfer is explicitly expressed (movement verb or clear movement construction present).  
Tag the locative phrase serving the movement role, not the movement verb itself.  
Do not infer missing endpoints or routes.  
If a place term is functioning as source/destination/path in a movement context, use MOV_* (not Cog4) for that phrase; use Cog4 only when the place/habitat is descriptive environment rather than a movement role.  
One label per token/phrase: MOV does not co-attach with Cog or PLACTAC.

6.4 Minimal examples  
"?Cog1: timber? is brought from ?MOV_SRC: the mountains? to ?MOV_DST: the city?."  
"?Cog1: resin? is transported along ?MOV_PATH: the river?."

7. Explicit Exclusions  
No discourse markers.  
No rhetorical structure.  
No causality beyond lexical expression.  
No teleology.  
No metaphor unpacking.  
No Cog5 unless there is actual interaction.  
No CogSlide unless the object becomes descriptively central.

8. Default Rule  
When uncertain: do nothing. Unannotated text is preferable to over-annotation.
