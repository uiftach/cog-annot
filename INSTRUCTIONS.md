Cog Annotation System Manual

Introduction and Guiding Principle
The Cog annotation system is a semantic tagging framework designed to label texts with rich information about objects and their related attributes, parts, and relations. Its guiding principle is object-centered semantics: meaning is primarily organized around objects (entities or things), and everything else (descriptions, parts, origins, interactions) is annotated in relation to those objects. In practice, this means annotators first identify the key objects mentioned in a text, and then layer on annotations for the properties, components, origins, and related entities of those objects. By focusing on objects as the central units of meaning, the system captures knowledge in a structured, intuitive way that mirrors how we often describe the world (we talk about a thing, then say what it’s like, what it has, where it’s from, what it does, etc.). This manual provides a comprehensive guide to using the Cog annotation system for both annotators and developers, ensuring consistency and clarity in annotation even for those not familiar with the source language or domain.
Object-Centered Semantics: In many descriptions, an object serves as the anchor point for information. For example, if a text discusses a tree, it will often enumerate the tree’s qualities, parts, and associated elements. Object-centered semantics means we treat “the tree” as the hub, and annotate all semantic details (tall, deep-rooted, leaves, growing in a certain place, visited by birds) as spokes connected to that hub. This approach aligns with the notion of identifying entities in text and then describing their properties and relations[1][2]. It ensures that each piece of information is linked to a concrete subject, facilitating understanding and later data integration (for instance, linking all information about a specific object for search or analysis). In the Cog system, no descriptive or relational tag floats freely – it’s always attached to an object. This layered structure of annotations (object first, then attributes and relations) not only reflects natural language patterns but also helps avoid misinterpretation by keeping context clear.
The Cog system was initially developed in the context of ancient botany texts (where descriptions of plants are rich with attributes and relations), but it is designed to be domain-agnostic. Whether you are annotating a botanical treatise, a zoological description, a technical manual, or a historical narrative, the same principles apply. This manual will walk through all categories in the Cog taxonomy, explain how to distinguish them with examples from multiple domains, and outline best practices for annotation layering, handling hierarchies, and complex cases. We will also cover practical usage tips for annotators and integration notes for developers, as well as general principles like keeping annotations minimal and descriptive (not interpretive) and respecting user sovereignty in how annotations are applied and used.
Overview of Cog Categories
The Cog annotation scheme defines several semantic categories (called Cog categories) that each serve a specific role in describing object-centered information. Below is the full typology of Cog categories, with definitions and examples for each. In summary, Cog categories include:
•	Cog1 – the main designated object/entity being discussed.
•	Cog1gen – a generic class or group from which specific Cog1 instances are drawn.
•	Cog1Ref – a reference object used purely for comparison, analogy, or measurement relative to the main object.
•	Cog2p – permanent properties or inherent characteristics of the object.
•	Cog2t – transient properties or states/conditions of the object that are temporary or time-bound.
•	Cog2v – processes or actions involving the object (what the object does or undergoes, typically expressed by verbs or verbal nouns).
•	Cog3Int – intrinsic parts or components of the object (its internal or attached parts).
•	Cog3Der – derived products or exudations from the object (things produced by or obtained from it, not integral parts of its structure).
•	Cog4 – provenance and association: locations, regions, or peoples associated with the object’s origin or context.
•	Cog5 – independent related objects: other objects that affect the main object or are affected by it (external agents, tools, other entities in interaction).
Each of these categories is explained in detail below. It is crucial for annotators to correctly identify which category a textual element belongs to, as this determines how it will be related to other annotations (for example, parts will be linked to wholes, properties will qualify objects, etc.).
Cog1: Designated Object/Entity (the Central Object)
Definition: Cog1 tags the primary object or entity being described or discussed. This is typically a concrete noun (or noun phrase) representing the thing that has properties, parts, and so on. In a sentence, the subject or main noun of interest is usually a Cog1. Cog1 is essentially the anchor for an annotation cluster – all other Cog tags (Cog2, Cog3, etc.) ultimately connect back to a Cog1.
Guideline: When reading a passage, ask “What is the thing being talked about or defined here?” That thing should be annotated as Cog1. There can be multiple Cog1s in a text if the text describes several objects, but you will usually mark each distinct object mention as a Cog1 (unless it falls under Cog1gen or Cog1Ref as defined later). Think of Cog1 as the instance or individual object in context.
Examples: - In a botany text: “The oak tree grows quickly.” Here “oak tree” is the object being described (tag it as Cog1). - In a zoology context: “The African elephant has large ears.” “African elephant” is Cog1 (the entity with features). - In a technical manual: “The engine consists of four cylinders.” “Engine” is the main object (Cog1). - In a historical text: “The city of Babylon was renowned for its walls.” “City of Babylon” is the object (Cog1) being talked about.
Note that a Cog1 can be a singular thing or a collective if the text treats it as one entity. For example, “Babylonian people” as a group might be tagged Cog1 if they are described as an entity with attributes. However, generic or class references (like “trees” in general or “fruit trees” as a category) fall under Cog1gen (see below). The Cog1 category covers specific instances or specific kinds being discussed as the topic.
One helpful way to test if something is a Cog1: Could the information in the sentence be phrased as “X is/has/does Y,” where X is that noun? If yes, X is likely a Cog1. For instance, “oak tree – grows quickly” (fits “oak tree is fast-growing”) means “oak tree” is Cog1, and “fast-growing” would be an attribute of it.
Cog1gen: Generic Group or Class
Definition: Cog1gen marks a generic class, category, or group of entities from which specific instances (Cog1) are drawn. It’s essentially the hypernym or broader category name that encompasses individual objects. Use Cog1gen for mentions of a type of thing in general, especially when the text is referring to a class rather than a particular instance.
How to Distinguish from Cog1: If the text is saying something about all X or X as a kind, then X should be Cog1gen. If it’s about a specific X (even if not a single individual, but a specific species or defined subset), it might be Cog1. The line can sometimes blur, but consider context: Cog1gen often appears in plural or with generic descriptors (e.g. “the fruit trees are generally fast-growing”) whereas Cog1 might be singular or a specific species name used as an example.
In practice, Cog1gen is used for taxonomic or categorical references, while Cog1 is used for the items within that category in the given context. A good analogy is hypernym vs. hyponym in semantics: Cog1gen is like a hypernym (the broader class) and Cog1 is a hyponym (a member of that class)[3]. For example, if a text says “Fruit trees (Cog1gen) include apple, pear, and cherry”, you would tag “fruit trees” as Cog1gen, and each specific tree name (“apple”, “pear”, “cherry”) as Cog1 (since they are individual kinds being listed).
Examples: - “Among fruit trees, the apple is very hardy.” – Here “fruit trees” is a general class (Cog1gen), and “apple” (short for apple tree) is a specific kind belonging to that class, so “apple” would be Cog1 in this sentence. - “Trees that grow by water, such as willows and poplars, tend to be tall.” – “Trees that grow by water” is a class description (Cog1gen). The examples “willows” and “poplars” are plural but refer to specific kinds; each of those could be tagged as Cog1 (instances of the waterside tree category). - In zoology: “The great apes (Cog1gen) include gorillas and orangutans.” – “great apes” is Cog1gen (the category), while “gorillas” and “orangutans” are instances (Cog1 in context). - In a tech context: “Screwdrivers (Cog1gen) are common tools; a Philips screwdriver (Cog1) has a cross-shaped tip.” – The first sentence uses the generic class of tools, the second mentions a specific type.
Use Cog1gen when the text is making a statement about a category rather than about a single entity. Often, Cog1gen phrases include words like “type”, “kind”, “class”, or are plural nouns representing a whole group. They might also appear in phrases like “those of the [group]” (e.g., “the leaves of conifers are needle-like” – here “conifers” is a class of trees, tag it Cog1gen). Remember that Cog1gen and Cog1 often work in tandem: authors might introduce a category (Cog1gen) and then give instances as examples (Cog1), as in “the waterside trees (Cog1gen) such as elm, plane, poplar (each Cog1) are fast-growing.”
Cog1Ref: Reference Object for Analogy or Measurement
Definition: Cog1Ref is used for objects that are mentioned only as a reference point, not because the text is describing that object for its own sake, but to say something about another object (usually a Cog1) by comparison, analogy, or measurement. In other words, if an object in the text serves as a metaphor, simile, unit, or point of reference to characterize the main object, tag it as Cog1Ref.
When to use: If you encounter phrases like “as [big] as a house,” “the size of an egg,” “more fragrant than a rose,” or “called X after the god Zeus,” the words “house,” “egg,” “rose,” and “god Zeus” are not themselves being described – they are only there to help describe something else. Those would be Cog1Ref. This category acknowledges that texts often use known entities to explain unknown ones (for example, comparing a fruit’s size to an orange, or saying an object is the “X of Y” where Y is a familiar reference).
Examples: - “The flower is as large as a dinner plate.” – “dinner plate” is used purely to convey size; annotate “dinner plate” as Cog1Ref (it’s an object, but a reference object for comparison). - “He was said to be as strong as Heracles.” – “Heracles” (Hercules) is a reference (mythological figure) to illustrate strength, tag it Cog1Ref. - “The sword’s blade was mirror-bright.” – “mirror” here is mentioned to emphasize brightness (analogy), so “mirror” is Cog1Ref. - “They measured land in football fields to convey its size.” – “football fields” (as units of area comparison) would be Cog1Ref. - In a scientific context: “A bacterium is about the size of a period on a printed page**.” – The “period on a printed page” is a reference object for size, Cog1Ref.
Cog1Ref objects often come into play with figurative language (similes, metaphors) and unit-like analogies. They are not the subject of description themselves; they help describe something else. A key test: if the sentence is still meaningful without elaborating on the reference object, or if the reference object could be swapped out with another reference without altering the main subject’s identity, it’s likely Cog1Ref. For instance, “the size of an egg” – we don’t care about the egg per se, just its size relation, so egg = Cog1Ref.
Keep in mind that Cog1Ref should not be used for actual parts or real relations of the object. It is specifically for external references. For example, in “The ship is a whale in the water,” “whale” is a metaphorical reference (Cog1Ref). But in “The ship has a whale carved on its bow,” the whale is an actual decoration (not just a comparison), which would make that whale a separate object (perhaps Cog5, an independent object associated). Use Cog1Ref for figurative or comparative mentions.
Cog2p: Permanent Properties of the Object
Definition: Cog2p tags permanent properties of an object – qualities or characteristics that are typically inherent, enduring attributes of the object. These are often adjectives (or adjectival phrases) describing what the object generally is like. A key aspect of Cog2p attributes is that they tend to hold true across time and context for that object (or at least for a long duration). They answer questions like “What kind of thing is this (by nature)?” or “What inherent attributes does it have?”
Characteristics: Permanent properties include things like shape, size (if generally consistent), color (if inherent), material, typical behavior or tendency, essential qualities, etc. In philosophy, these align with what are sometimes called individual-level predicates or inherent traits, as opposed to temporary states[4][5]. For example, gold being yellow and metal is inherent, while being in a particular shape is transient[5]. We annotate the inherent traits as Cog2p.
Examples: - “The oak is a tall tree with rugged bark.” – “tall” and “rugged [bark]” describe inherent qualities of the oak (assuming oaks are generally tall and the bark is inherently rugged in texture). Tag both as Cog2p. - “Elephants are gray and thick-skinned.” – These are permanent traits (color, skin thickness) of elephants, so “gray” and “thick-skinned” are Cog2p. - “This car has a V8 engine and all-wheel drive.” – While “V8 engine” and “all-wheel drive” are features rather than adjectives, they are permanent characteristics of the car’s design. In context, they function as defining properties (Cog2p) of that car model. - “The alloy is magnetic.” – Magnetism is an inherent property of that alloy (if it’s a constant trait), tag as Cog2p. - “Roses are perennial plants.” – “perennial” (lives for several years) is a permanent property of roses (as opposed to annual plants). Cog2p for “perennial.”
The line between permanent and transient can sometimes depend on context or framing. For example, “The door is open” vs “the door is wooden.” Wooden is a permanent material property (Cog2p); open is a current state (Cog2t, see below). A useful criterion: if removing the property fundamentally changes what the object is, then it’s likely a permanent property. Another clue: properties that are part of definitions or typical descriptions are usually permanent. We also consider tendencies or default behaviors as Cog2p if they are essentially part of the object’s identity (e.g., “Sunflowers are tall-growing plants” – height tendency, Cog2p).
Permanent does not mean immutable for eternity, but rather enduring or characteristic in the scope of discourse. For instance, “adult elephants are heavy” – being heavy is normal for an elephant (Cog2p). Contrast that with, say, “this elephant is sick right now” – sickness is not a normal inherent trait (that’s Cog2t transient).
Cog2t: Transient Properties or States
Definition: Cog2t is used for transient properties – states, conditions, or qualities of an object that are temporary, conditional, or time-bound. These are attributes that an object can acquire or lose over time or under certain circumstances. They answer questions like “How is it right now?” or “In what condition/state does it appear?”
Characteristics: Transient properties often include conditions like current color or appearance (if changeable), health, mood (for animate objects), temperature, phase (for matter), or any state that is not always true for the object. In linguistics, these often correspond to stage-level predicates, describing a temporary state[6]. For example, being wet, open, broken (if fixable), or flowering (for a plant) are transient conditions.
Examples: - “The oak’s leaves are yellow in autumn.” – For a deciduous tree, green vs yellow leaves depend on season. “Yellow” here is a seasonal (temporary) state, so tag it as Cog2t. - “The animal is asleep.” – “asleep” is a temporary state (the animal won’t always be asleep), so Cog2t. - “This metal becomes hot when heated.” – “hot” in this context is a transient condition (temperature can change), Cog2t. - “The door is open.” – The door’s openness is a current state (not an inherent trait of the door forever), tag “open” as Cog2t. - “During drought, the plant is wilted.” – “wilted” is a transient condition caused by lack of water, Cog2t.
A transient property often implies a contrast with another state the object could be in. If you can think of an object being not in that state at another time, it’s transient. For instance, “ripe” vs “unripe” fruit, “running” vs “stopped” machine, “charged” vs “discharged” battery – these are states, hence Cog2t.
Sometimes the same adjective can be either permanent or transient depending on context. For example, “a dark horse” could be permanent if referring to coat color, but “the room is dark” is transient (lighting). Annotators should judge by context: is the text implying this is a defining trait or a current condition? If unsure, consider whether it’s tied to a time or condition (words like now, today, when , if often signal transient), or if it’s presented as a quality inherent to the object regardless of circumstances.
It’s also useful to note that transient properties in text might be conveyed by participles or adjectives that clearly derive from verbs (e.g., “broken,” “wilted,” “frozen”) – these often indicate a state resulting from some event, hence not permanent. Meanwhile, permanent ones are often basic adjectives or relational adjectives (“wooden,” “carnivorous,” etc.).
Cog2v: Processes or Actions (Verbal Descriptors)
Definition: Cog2v annotations capture processes, actions, or activities associated with the object. These are typically verbs (or verbal nouns/gerunds) that describe what the object does or what happens to the object, in relation to its inherent nature or typical behavior. In the object-centered approach, we treat these processes as another layer of description of the object (what it undergoes or performs) rather than independent events.
What qualifies: Use Cog2v for any mention of growth, movement, function, usage, or change that is anchored to the object. For instance, if a text says “the plant blooms in spring” or “the machine stops automatically,” those verbs “blooms” and “stops” relate to the object’s behavior or processes – mark them as Cog2v. These often pair with or qualify Cog2p or Cog2t attributes (hence annotation clusters, see later).
Examples: - “The oak grows rapidly in fertile soil.” – “grows” (or “grows rapidly”) is a process concerning the oak (the oak is doing it), tag “grows” (and include “rapidly” as part of that phrase if needed) as Cog2v. This is an ongoing or typical process. - “Many pine trees exude resin when cut.” – “exude resin” describes a process the pine tree undergoes; “exude” would be Cog2v (and “resin” here is the product, which might be annotated separately as Cog3Der). - “The device emits light once triggered.” – “emits” is an action of the device, Cog2v. - “The flower is blooming.” – “blooming” (even as a participle) is the process/state of blooming, we tag it as Cog2v (it’s a verb form indicating an ongoing action by the flower). - “When threatened, the cat sprays water.” – “sprays” (verb) is an action performed by the cat (object), Cog2v.
Cog2v thus often overlaps with what we think of as events or actions, but in this annotation scheme we anchor them to the object. In terms of relations, a Cog2v will usually be linked via a “PROCESS_OF” relation to a Cog1 (or to a part of the object, if the process is specific to a part). For example, “leaves fall”: “fall” (verb) is a process of leaves (part of tree), so “fall” is Cog2v linked to the leaf (Cog3Int, which in turn links to tree Cog1).
It’s important not to tag every verb as Cog2v blindly. Only tag verbs that convey meaningful processes related to the object’s inherent narrative. Some verbs might be purely auxiliary or connectives (“there is”, “has” in a generic sense might indicate possession rather than a process – those we often capture differently, like a part or property rather than Cog2v). But verbs that describe actual actions or changes (grow, feed, rotate, erupt, etc.) are fair game.
Cog2p vs Cog2v vs Cog2t: There can be subtle interplay. For instance, tendency vs action: “The plant is fast-growing” – “fast-growing” could be seen as a permanent trait (it has the quality of growing fast, Cog2p), but the word “growing” is verbal in origin. We treat “fast-growing” as basically “grows fast habitually,” which we can still consider an inherent property (so likely Cog2p with an embedded notion of process). However, if a sentence emphasizes the action: “The plant grows fast every summer,” then “grows” (present tense action) is Cog2v, and “fast” qualifies that process. This might lead to a cluster (Cog2v + a qualifier which might be treated as Cog2p or just part of the phrase). We discuss clustering later, but the main idea is to capture processes with Cog2v.
Modal/affordance phrasing: Expressions of capability or suitability (e.g., posse / “can”, or statements of what something is able to do) are still treated as Cog2v when they encode an object-anchored process or behavioral affordance. They are not excluded merely because they are modal or potential rather than episodic.
Domain note: In technical manuals or procedural text, Cog2v is very common (machines operate, start, fail, etc., organisms digest, respire, etc.). In descriptive passages, some verbs might be states (“stands tall” is more state-like, but we might still tag “stands” as Cog2v since it’s describing posture). Use your judgment, keeping in mind the goal is to mark dynamic attributes of the object.
Cog3Int: Intrinsic Parts/Components of the Object
Definition: Cog3Int denotes intrinsic parts or components of an object – these are the elements that compose the object or are physically attached to it as parts of the whole. Essentially, if you can say “X is a part of Y,” with X being something naturally or structurally part of the object Y, then X should be tagged as Cog3Int (with Y likely being Cog1 or another part higher in the hierarchy).
Examples of parts: For a living organism, parts are anatomical (roots, trunk, branches of a tree; head, tail of an animal; petals of a flower). For a device or artifact, parts are its components (engine of a car, handle of a tool, keyboard of a laptop). For a place, parts could be sub-regions or sections (the nave of a cathedral, the wing of a building). The crucial aspect is that these parts are integral to the whole’s identity or structure.
Relation: Every Cog3Int will usually be connected by a PART_OF relation to the object it belongs to. This reflects the meronymy (part-whole relationship) in semantic terms[7]. For example, “leaf” is Cog3Int and part of “tree” (Cog1), “wheel” is Cog3Int part of “car” (Cog1). Meronyms (parts) and their holonyms (wholes) form a hierarchy[7], which the annotation will capture as a component tree (discussed in Hierarchies section).
Examples: - “The tree has roots, a trunk, and branches.” – “roots”, “trunk”, “branches” are all parts of the tree (so each is Cog3Int, linked to the tree Cog1). These correspond to the classic part-whole: roots, trunk, branches, and leaves are parts of a tree[7]. - “Birds have wings, beaks, and feathers.” – Each of those is a part of a bird, so tag each as Cog3Int (linked to “bird” Cog1). - “The car’s engine and wheels are new.” – “engine” and “wheels” are components of the car, both Cog3Int (parts of car Cog1). - “Inside the cell, the nucleus contains DNA.” – “nucleus” is a part of the cell (Cog3Int, part of cell Cog1). - “The book’s cover is torn.” – “cover” is a part of the book, Cog3Int.
Cog3Int can apply to hierarchical parts as well. For example, a part can itself have sub-parts. In a text, if those sub-parts are discussed, they would also be Cog3Int (but part of another Cog3Int). For instance, “branches have twigs and leaves.” Here, if “branches” is already a Cog3Int part of tree, then “twigs” and “leaves” are parts of branches. We would still tag “twigs” and “leaves” as Cog3Int (parts in the system), and use PART_OF relations: leaves PART_OF branch, branch PART_OF tree. The system supports building such component trees (see Hierarchical Structures below).
Distinguishing parts from other categories: Sometimes a noun could be either a part or a separate object depending on context. The rule of thumb: if it’s a physically attached or included element of the main object, it’s a part (Cog3Int). If it’s an associated but not integral thing, it might be Cog5 (independent). For example, “moss on a tree” – moss is a separate organism growing on the tree, not a structural part of the tree, so moss would be Cog5 (an independent object affecting the tree). But “leaves on a tree” – leaves are biologically part of the tree, so leaves are Cog3Int.
Also, distinguish parts from products (Cog3Der): If it’s something the object produces or sheds, especially if not attached at the time of consideration, it might be product. For example, fruit can be tricky – while fruit grows on the tree (part of it when attached), fruit might be considered a product if harvested. In descriptive text, fruit on a tree would usually be Cog3Int (it’s attached, part of the plant’s body); fruit mentioned as something the tree yields (especially once fallen or picked) might be Cog3Der. Use context: “fruit-bearing tree” – fruit are considered generically as things it produces (Cog3Der perhaps), but listing the fruit on its branches at a given time can be seen as part. We cover Cog3Der next, but keep this in mind.
Cog3Der: Derived Products or Exudations of the Object
Definition: Cog3Der covers derived products, outputs, or exudates of an object – things that come out of it, are produced by it, or obtained from it, but are not structurally part of it (especially once separated). These are often materials or substances that the object yields. The classical example given is timber from a tree – wood is derived from the tree but once it’s cut timber, it’s no longer a part of the tree, it’s a product of it. Similarly, resin or sap oozing from a tree, milk from a cow, honey from bees, silk from silkworms, eggs from a hen – all these are Cog3Der relative to the source object.
Think of Cog3Der as capturing a has-product relationship (though in our annotation we might use a relation like PROCESS_OF or a specialized relation to link it to the object, depending on context). These items are often tangible outputs or natural substances produced by the main object, and often used or collected separately.
Examples: - “Oak trees provide excellent timber.” – “timber” (wood) is a product of the tree (Cog3Der). It’s something we get from oak trees[8]. - “The cow gives milk.” – “milk” is a product of the cow, Cog3Der (milk is a bodily fluid from the cow)[8]. - “Bees secrete wax to build their honeycombs.” – “wax” is a product (exudation) of bees, Cog3Der. - “Pine trees produce sticky resin.” – “resin” (or sap) is an exudate from the pine, Cog3Der[8]. - “Silkworms create silk threads.” – “silk” is derived from silkworms (product), Cog3Der[8]. - “The machine outputs heat as a byproduct.” – “heat” in this context is something produced by the machine’s operation. Although heat is energy, not an object, it can still be annotated as a derived output (Cog3Der) of the machine (especially if the text treats it as a thing). Note: We primarily use Cog categories for tangible things, but if the context treats an output like heat or sound as an entity, we might capture it. Usually, though, Cog3Der will be tangible or material.
Distinguishing from parts: If something remains part of the object until a process separates it, it might be borderline. For example: fruit – when on the tree, it’s a part (Cog3Int); when considered as a yield (like “this tree’s fruit is tasty” or “the tree produces fruit”), it leans into Cog3Der territory. Another example: hair or wool – on the animal, hair is part of it; once cut or shed, hair (or wool) is a product harvested from it. In annotation, use the phrasing: If the text says “sheep’s wool is valuable,” “wool” is being discussed as a commodity from sheep, so tag “wool” Cog3Der. If the text says “the sheep has thick wool on its body,” that’s describing a part of the sheep’s body (so “wool” there might be Cog3Int, as part of the fleece). The context guides the decision.
Exudations specifically refers to fluids or substances secreted or discharged. E.g., sap, resin, nectar, sweat, tears (if describing person or animal products). These are typically Cog3Der because they come out of the object. Note that Cog3Der could also include byproducts of processes, not just naturally secreted ones. For a volcano (if volcano were an object), lava and ash would be products (though one might simply treat those as separate phenomena, but in an object-centric approach, “volcano’s ash” could be product of volcano).
In terms of relations, we might describe product relationships with something akin to “DERIVED_FROM” or treat them as a special case of part or process. The edge between part and product is that parts are still attached, products are removed or externalized. The Cog system chooses to separate them conceptually for clarity.
Cog4: Provenance, Location, or Affiliation (Origin/Association)
Definition: Cog4 covers provenance, location, and associated regions or peoples for the object. This category is used for any mention of where the object comes from, where it is found, or what location or cultural group is tied to it. In short, if the text associates an object with a place or origin, that place name or demonym (people/group name) should be Cog4. Think of Cog4 as tagging the “of/in/from [Place/People]” information.
What it includes: - Geographical locations: countries, regions, habitats, specific sites. - Adjectives of origin: e.g., “Egyptian” in “Egyptian cotton” (the nationality or regional adjective gets Cog4). - Groups of people or cultures: if an object is associated with a certain people (e.g., “Aztec gold” – Aztec as the people of origin). - Also possibly historical or mythical places if mentioned in context of origin (“made in Valhalla” – though mythical, it’s a place reference, Cog4).
The essence is origin or context of location. The word provenance literally means the place of origin or earliest known history of something[9]. So if a text mentions that origin/history context, that’s a Cog4 annotation.
Examples: - “This grape is native to France.” – “France” is a location associated with the grape’s origin, tag “France” as Cog4. - “The Himalayan cedar grows at high altitudes.” – “Himalayan” (as an adjective indicating from the Himalayas region) would be Cog4. - “Persian silk was highly prized.” – “Persian” indicates origin (Persia/Iran) of the silk, Cog4. - “The tree thrives in swampy wetlands.” – This is a type of location (habitat) rather than a proper place name, but it’s the environment location. We still tag “swampy wetlands” as Cog4 because it’s essentially a location context for the object (where does it thrive? in swampy wetlands). - “The machine was manufactured in Germany.” – “Germany” is the place of origin (Cog4) for the machine. - “According to legend, the herb only grows on Athena’s hill.” – “Athena’s hill” (if that’s a location name) would be Cog4 (a location associated with the herb). - “It was first documented by the Romans.” – Here, “Romans” refers to a people/culture. If the text is associating the object with the Romans (as in Romans discovered or used it), “Romans” can be tagged as Cog4 (people associated with it).
Note: Cog4 is about association with a place or group, not an independent entity acting (that would be Cog5 if a person is acting on it). If the text says “discovered by Dr. X,” the person “Dr. X” is a specific individual (that might not fall under Cog4 or Cog5 easily – one might leave a specific individual untagged or treat as Cog5, but typically Cog4 is more for collective or location-based association). However, if it says “discovered by the Romans” that’s a collective cultural context, so Cog4 fits (they are associated with its use, arguably). Use context: if it's ownership/history context, Cog4; if they're actively doing something in the scene, Cog5.
In some cases, provenance can overlap with part-of phrasing if a region is named after something. For example, “India’s forests” – if describing a species in those forests, “India” is location (Cog4). If the syntax is “forest of India,” still Cog4 for “India.”
Also, ethnonyms (names of ethnic groups or nations used as adjectives) are Cog4 in context of describing an object. For instance, “Greek fire” (the famous incendiary weapon) – “Greek” is Cog4 (the culture of origin). Or “Japanese art” – “Japanese” Cog4 for origin culture.
We should also tag habitat or geographic range descriptions as Cog4, since those are locations relevant to the object. E.g., “found in coastal areas” – “coastal areas” is a location context, Cog4.
In terms of relations, a Cog4 item will link to the object often with a relation like “PROVENANCE_OF” or a general “ASSOCIATED_WITH.” From our data, we saw a relation PROVENANCE_OF linking such annotations. For example, if “Asia” is mentioned for a plant, you’d have Asia (Cog4) – PROVENANCE_OF – that plant (Cog1).
One more point: Cog4 might also include sub-locations or regions specific to the object’s presence, such as “rooted in the ground” – The example in the Greek text was “ἐν τῇ γῇ” (“in the earth/ground”) tagged as Cog4. So even a common noun location (“ground”, “soil”, “riverbank”) can be Cog4 if it’s indicating where the object is located or originates. Essentially, if you answer “Where is it?” or “From where does it come?”, you’re dealing with Cog4 information.
Cog5: Independent Objects Affecting/Affected by the Main Object
Definition: Cog5 is used for independent objects that are mentioned because they interact with, affect, or are affected by the main object (Cog1). These are entities in the scene that are neither part of the object nor just a location or reference – they are other things in their own right, but the text brings them up due to some relationship (often causal or functional) with the main object. They often fill roles like agent, patient, instrument, or companion in relation to the main object.
In simpler terms, Cog5 covers “other things in the picture.” For example, predators of an animal, pollinators of a plant, tools used on an object, or objects an artifact acts upon – all these are separate entities playing a role.
Examples: - “Goats eat the young tree seedlings.” – Here the focus might be the seedlings (if seedlings are Cog1 being described), then “goats” are external animals affecting them (goats = Cog5). The verb “eat” would be a process linking goats and seedlings (“eat” as Cog2v or a relation). - “This plant repels insects.” – If the plant is Cog1, “insects” (which are repelled) are other creatures interacting with it, so tag “insects” as Cog5 (they are affected by the plant’s properties). - “The farmer cuts the tree with an axe.” – If the tree is our main object of interest (Cog1), then “farmer” (the agent causing an effect) and “axe” (instrument) are both independent entities relative to the tree. We’d tag “farmer” as Cog5 and “axe” as Cog5 as well. They have roles (one is a person doing something to the tree, the other an object used on the tree). - “Symbiotic fungi live on the tree’s roots.” – The fungi are separate organisms interacting with the tree, so “fungi” = Cog5 (they affect/benefit the tree and vice versa). - “The engine drives the wheels of the car.” – If “engine” is Cog3Int (part of car) and we’re focusing on car, “wheels” are also Cog3Int parts of car in this case. Not a Cog5. But if the sentence was “The car turns a mill via a belt,” and if the car is main object, “mill” is another object being turned by the car’s mechanism – that “mill” would be Cog5 (another object affected by the car). - “The patient uses a walking stick.” – If “patient” (a person, Cog1) is our main object being described, the walking stick is a separate object they use (Cog5). - In a military description: “The tank was destroyed by a missile.” – If tank is Cog1, “missile” is an external object acting on it (Cog5).
The challenge with Cog5 is it’s somewhat a catch-all for entities that don’t fit earlier categories but are present due to interactions. A Cog5 is not just mentioned in passing like a reference (that would be Cog1Ref) and not inherently part of the main object’s identity like a part or property. It’s like a second actor or object in the narrative involving the main object.
When annotating, ask: Is this thing I’m about to tag an integral part of the main object (if yes, Cog3Int), produced by the object (Cog3Der), a location for the object (Cog4), or just being used as a comparison (Cog1Ref)? If none of those, but it’s clearly an entity present in the scenario doing something to/with the main object (or vice versa), then it’s likely Cog5.
Typical relations with Cog5: The text often will have a verb connecting the main object and the Cog5 entity (like eats, repels, cuts, was destroyed by, uses, etc.). In the annotation, that verb itself might be marked as Cog2v (if we anchor it to the main object) or sometimes one might consider a relation edge like EFFECT_ON or similar. In our provided data, we didn’t see a specific “affects” relation, but the presence of Cog5 implies an interaction often captured by a process (Cog2v). For example, “goats eat seedlings” – we tag “goats” Cog5, “eat” Cog2v (process of seedlings or something) and link accordingly.
Edge considerations: People are often involved in texts. If a person is mentioned not as the object of description but as someone doing something to the object, that person would be Cog5. E.g., “cultivated by farmers” – “farmers” Cog5. If the text is about a person as the main subject, then that person is Cog1 and other people interacting with them would be Cog5. (The scheme can apply to human-centric narratives too, though originally devised for objects like plants.)
Also, note the difference between Cog5 and Cog1Ref: Cog1Ref is a reference frame, Cog5 is an active participant. For example, “as tall as a house” (house is reference, Cog1Ref) vs “shaded by a house” (house is physically present affecting the object by shading it, so “house” would be Cog5 in that scenario since it’s an actual interacting object, not just a metaphorical yardstick).
Finally, Cog5 is often where causal or usage relationships get captured. An independent object might be a cause or effect in relation to the main object. E.g., “frost (Cog5) kills the plant (Cog1)”, or “the device (Cog1) uses batteries (Cog5)”. We tag those external causes or requirements as Cog5.
With the categories defined, the next sections will describe how to apply them in practice, including layering (the order and way to combine these tags), handling hierarchical structures of objects, grouping, clustering multiple tags on one expression, examples, and usage instructions.
Cog5 extensions (no promotion): A Cog5 entity may be the grammatical or causal source of a process/state annotation (e.g., a verb tagged as Cog2v) without being promoted to Cog1. Promotion to Cog1 is only justified when the discourse focus shifts so that this entity becomes the designated main object of the passage (scene-level change), not merely because predicates attach to it.
Principles of Annotation Layering
One of the core methodological principles of the Cog system is layered annotation. This means annotations occur in stages or layers, ensuring the foundational elements (objects) are identified before their related aspects (properties, parts, etc.) are attached. The layering approach leads to clarity and prevents errors like attributing a property with no object to attach to.
Key rules of layering:
•	Objects First, Relations Second: Always annotate objects (Cog1, Cog1gen, Cog1Ref, Cog5) before annotating anything about them. An object provides the anchor needed for other tags. If you see an adjective describing a plant, you should ensure the plant is tagged as Cog1 (or relevant category) before tagging the adjective as Cog2p or Cog2t. If you see a part mentioned, the whole it belongs to should ideally be tagged already (or you tag it simultaneously, but conceptually the whole needs to be identified to link the part).
•	Cog1 precedes Cog2/3/4/5: Specifically, a Cog1 (or Cog1gen) should be established in a passage prior to tagging Cog2, Cog3, Cog4 categories that relate to it. Practically, this might mean you skim a sentence, mark the nouns (objects) first, then mark adjectives (properties) and other details next. This rule is logical: you can’t have a property without a thing that has the property, you can’t have a part without a whole it’s part of, etc. Ensuring Cog1 is in place prevents “dangling” tags.
•	Layer by dependency: Another way to see it: more dependent information (like a quality, which depends on some object to qualify) should be layered on after the independent element is marked. Cog1 and Cog5 entities can often stand alone as nouns in text (they’re independent mentions), whereas Cog2, Cog3, Cog4 are inherently describing or linked to something else.
•	Temporal layering in process: If using an annotation tool, you might first pass through the text highlighting all objects (layer 1), then go back and highlight properties and parts and link them (layer 2). Some annotators find it helpful to color-code categories (e.g., highlight all Cog1 in one color first) then do Cog2, etc., to enforce this layered approach.
•	Layering and Document Structure: Sometimes texts have segments where an object isn’t explicitly mentioned but implied. E.g., several sentences in a paragraph all about the same subject – you tag the object the first time it appears (layer1). In subsequent sentences, adjectives might appear without repeating the noun. In such cases, you still conceptually consider the object present. You might tag a pronoun or implied subject as Cog1 if needed, or carry over the link. The idea remains: the object layer anchors everything. Don’t tag a free-floating adjective in sentence 2 without ensuring it ties back to the object from sentence 1.
Special case – Cog1gen layering: If a sentence talks generically (Cog1gen) and then specifics: “Of the fruit trees (Cog1gen), the apple (Cog1) is most resilient.” You would tag “fruit trees” Cog1gen first, then “apple” Cog1. Here “apple” is indeed an object instance, but its context (fruit trees category) appears first. Typically, you’ll mark both in one read (they are both objects, one general, one specific). The property “most resilient” would then be tagged as Cog2p linked to “apple” (since the comparison is among fruit trees). Ensure the general class is also marked before linking anything to it.
In summary, layering is about incremental annotation: establish the scaffolding (objects) then add detail (attributes, parts, etc.). This approach aligns with logical dependency and results in a well-structured annotation graph where every descriptive node attaches to an object node. It helps maintain minimality (we only annotate things with a clear purpose and attachment) and clarity (each tag’s role is evident by its link to an object).
Relational Indexing: Track Indices as Attachment Links
Purpose: To integrate attachment information into the same inline annotation layer, every tag carries a track index. The track index functions as an explicit, mechanically interpretable link to the qualified object (or its subpart), so downstream graph construction does not require a separate stand-off layer.
Core convention: ⟨LABEL#k: …⟩. The same numeric index (#k) indicates the same object track in scope. Annotators reuse an existing index when reference returns to the same object; a new index is introduced only when a new designated object track is introduced (scene/anchor shift, not mere predicate attachment).
Part hierarchy via dot paths: Cog3Int uses dot paths on the same track index: ⟨Cog3Int#k.1: …⟩ is a part of Cog1#k; ⟨Cog3Int#k.1.1: …⟩ is a subpart of Cog3Int#k.1, etc.
Mechanical interpretation rules (default):
• Cog2p#k / Cog2t#k / CogAff#k QUALIFIES Cog1#k.
• Cog2v#k PROCESS_OF Cog1#k (object-anchored processes, including modal/affordance statements).
• Cog3Int#k.x PART_OF Cog1#k; Cog3Int#k.x.y PART_OF Cog3Int#k.x.
• Cog2p#k.x / Cog2t#k.x / Cog2v#k.x / CogAff#k.x attach to (QUALIFIES/PROCESS_OF) the part at Cog3Int#k.x.
• Cog3Der#k DERIVED_FROM the source track Cog1#k (or Cog5#k if the source is explicitly treated as Cog5).
• Cog4*#k (Cog4r/Cog4c as used in practice) attaches to the same track: LOCATION_OF / PROVENANCE_OF Cog1#k.
Equivalence/tantamount terms: when two expressions are semantically tantamount (e.g., anaphoric “iis quae sunt culta” for “locis”, or “agro” for “terra” in a specific passage), prefer reuse of the same track index (#k). Optionally include an explicit marker inside the tag content (e.g., “agro ≡ terra”) to make the intended merge auditable.
Editorial supplements remain bracketed inside tag content, e.g. ⟨Cog3Int#1.1: [ῥίζας]⟩.
Examples:
⟨Cog2p#1: ἐπιπολῆς⟩ δὲ ⟨Cog1#1: σφένδαμνον⟩ καὶ ⟨Cog2p#1: ὀλίγας⟩ ⟨Cog3Int#1.1: [ῥίζας]⟩·
… ἐκ τοῦ ⟨Cog3Int#1.1.1: ἄκρου⟩ τῶν ⟨Cog3Int#1.1: βλαστῶν⟩ …
Hierarchical Object Structures and Component Trees
Many objects are not isolated wholes; they have parts, and those parts might have sub-parts, forming a hierarchy. The Cog system handles this via hierarchical object structures: essentially, a tree (in the data structure sense) of objects and parts. Annotators should be aware of how to tag and link such hierarchies, and how to handle cases of object grouping or multiple objects together.
Part-Whole Hierarchies (Component Trees)
When an object’s parts are themselves complex, you might end up with multiple levels of Cog3Int annotations. For example:
•	Object (Cog1): Car
•	Part (Cog3Int): Engine
o	Part of part (Cog3Int): Cylinder
•	Part (Cog3Int): Wheel
o	Part of part (Cog3Int): Tire
In such a scenario, you tag each part as Cog3Int. Now, how to represent the hierarchy? Each part gets a PART_OF relation to its immediate whole. So: - “Engine” PART_OF “Car” - “Cylinder” PART_OF “Engine” (by transitivity, cylinder is also part of car, but the direct link is to engine). - “Wheel” PART_OF “Car” - “Tire” PART_OF “Wheel”
This forms a component tree in the annotation graph (car at top, branches down to tires, etc.). The system inherently allows this because there’s no rule that Cog3Int must link directly to Cog1 – it can link to another Cog3Int, as long as the chain eventually leads to a Cog1 (Cog1 is the root of the object tree).
Annotators should annotate each mentioned part at the level it’s mentioned and connect it appropriately: - If the text says “the engine’s cylinders are cast iron,” you tag “engine” (if not already from context) and “cylinders” as Cog3Int. Then link “cylinders” PART_OF “engine.” “Engine” presumably is PART_OF “car” if already known. - If a part is mentioned without the whole explicitly stated (e.g., a sentence just says “its cylinders are cast iron” right after talking about the engine), you might have to infer the link: here “cylinders” are part of “engine” which is known context. In annotation, you may either have the engine tagged from prior sentence or tag it if needed and then link.
Object Grouping vs Hierarchies: Sometimes texts mention a group of objects as a collection. For example, “a cluster of grapes” or “a herd of cows.” These are not part-whole in the sense of physical integration, but collective nouns. How to handle? - “Cluster of grapes” – a cluster is a grouping object that consists of grapes. One way: tag “cluster” as Cog1 (it’s the thing being described perhaps) and “grapes” as Cog1gen or Cog3Int? But grapes aren’t parts permanently attached; they are individually whole fruits, but in the cluster context, they form a collective. We might treat the cluster vs members analogous to whole vs parts for annotation purposes. It could be reasonable to tag “grapes” (the members) as Cog3Int (part) of the cluster (the cluster is basically composed of grapes). This is a case of object grouping being handled like a whole-part temporarily. Alternatively, one might tag each grape as Cog1, but that’s tedious and unnecessary if we’re talking about them collectively. It’s more logical to represent “cluster (Cog1) – PART_OF-> grapes??” or rather “grapes – PART_OF -> cluster” (the cluster is whole, grapes are components). Yes, we’d do “grapes” as Cog3Int (components) part_of “cluster” (Cog1). If the text then described the cluster’s property like “the cluster is heavy,” we link that to cluster. If it described an individual grape, that might not happen unless zooming in.
•	“Herd of cows” – If the herd’s behavior is described, herd as Cog1 (collective). The cows within are the members – you might not need to tag “cows” separately if “herd” covers it conceptually. But if text says something like “The 50 cows in the herd…” then “cows” might be a plural object reference inside the herd context. Possibly tag “cows” Cog3Int with PART_OF “herd”.
In general, the Cog system wasn’t explicitly about statistical groups, but you can adapt the part-whole to represent membership when needed.
Layering still applies in hierarchies: Ensure the top-level object is tagged (Cog1), then parts (Cog3Int) linked, then sub-parts (Cog3Int) linked to those parts, etc., before tagging any properties of the parts. For instance, “the car’s engine’s cylinders are cast iron” – tag car (Cog1), engine (Cog3Int of car), cylinders (Cog3Int of engine). Then tag “cast iron” (material property) of cylinders as Cog2p, linking it to “cylinders.”
Meronymy vs Class Hierarchy: Don’t confuse part-of hierarchy with class hierarchy. Class hierarchy would be like “oak is a type of tree” – that’s not part-of, that’s type-of (we covered with Cog1gen/Cog1). Part-of is physical inclusion[7]. The annotation should reflect part-of. So use PART_OF for linking Cog3Int to their wholes, not IS_A (the latter would be like linking Cog1gen to Cog1 maybe, but typically we don’t link those via annotation edges in this system – Cog1gen vs Cog1 is implicit category membership, not a physical relation).
Non-physical part relationships: Sometimes something can be considered part in an abstract sense (like a chapter of a book, which is not physical but part of a larger work). Cog3Int could be used for logical parts too (chapter part of book). We focus on physical mostly, but it’s plausible to extend concept to conceptual wholes.
Handling Multiple Main Objects and Grouped Mentions
A text might describe multiple objects in parallel or a set of objects together. Here are some guidelines:
•	If objects are listed (e.g., a list of species or items all being described), each can be tagged as its own Cog1. For example, “In this forest, oaks, pines, and birches are common.” – Tag each tree type as Cog1 (since the sentence is about all of them generally). If a property is then stated collectively – “are common” applies to all, you might either tag “are common” once and link it to each? Usually, you’d tag “common” as Cog2p and possibly attach it to a plural phrase “oaks, pines, and birches” if you tagged that as one span covering all three as a plural group. Alternatively, tag each species as Cog1 and then annotate “common” three times (that’s clunky). A better approach: If items are enumerated and share the same property, you may annotate the property once over the whole phrase, or tag the whole group as one entity. This depends on your annotation granularity. Often, enumerations can be grouped in a single annotation if they function as a list, or one could create a higher-order node representing the set. The Cog system doesn’t explicitly define a category for a collection other than Cog1gen for a class. If it’s just listing examples, you might handle it by context.
•	Object grouping using Cog1gen? – If the text uses a plural but clearly as a general category, that’s Cog1gen. If it’s enumerating specifics, use Cog1 multiple times or cover them in one go. For example, “Elm, oak, and willow trees (the waterside trees) grow here.” Possibly tag “elm”, “oak”, “willow” each as Cog1 and also “waterside trees” as Cog1gen (class) if that appears. Or if not, you might group them mentally.
•	If a plural is basically referring to multiple instances of the same kind collectively (like “the elephants migrated”), just tag that plural noun as Cog1 (covering the group as a whole object concept in that context).
•	Coordination: If an adjective applies to one and not the other in a phrase “the tall oaks and pines” where maybe pines aren’t tall, context is ambiguous – likely it means both oaks and pines are tall. It’s safe to tag “tall” as Cog2p linked to both. The tool might require separate linking or you tag “tall” twice. Many annotation setups allow one annotation to link to multiple targets if needed (but not all do). If not, you might need to annotate it separately for each, which is more an implementation detail. But logically, it’s describing both.
•	Cross-hierarchy relations: A part of one object interacting with part of another, etc., can happen. E.g., “lion’s teeth injure the elephant’s skin.” If lion and elephant are Cog1 (two different objects in one scene), “teeth” is part of lion (Cog3Int linked to lion), “skin” part of elephant. The action “injure” is between them. You’d mark lion Cog1, elephant Cog1 (maybe the main focus is elephant? But anyway), teeth Cog3Int of lion, skin Cog3Int of elephant, “injure” Cog2v. This is a complex multi-object scenario. The scheme can handle it; you’d have two separate object trees and a process linking across. You’d have to choose perspective about which object anchors the action but capturing all pieces is key.
Summary: Hierarchies are captured by repeated use of Cog1/Cog3Int categories and linking them appropriately: - Always connect Cog3Int to either a Cog1 or another Cog3Int above it. - The result should be a connected graph: starting from a Cog1 (root) you can traverse PART_OF links and reach all parts. - If something ends up isolated (a part with no whole, or a property with no object), that’s an annotation error to fix.
Annotation Clusters: Multi-Tagging a Single Expression
In many cases, a single word or phrase in the text might embody more than one semantic role as defined by Cog categories. The Cog system allows annotators to create annotation clusters, where multiple tags are applied to one span or closely related spans to fully capture the meaning. This typically happens when a phrase carries compound information.
What is an annotation cluster? It means two or more Cog annotations that together describe one unit of text. They are distinct tags but are conceptually linked as describing the same thing from different angles. For example, a phrase might indicate both a property and a process, or a part and a property at once.
Common cluster scenarios: - Property + Process (Cog2p + Cog2v): A single word or phrase can sometimes be seen as both a descriptive adjective and an implicit action. The example given was Cog2p + Cog2v: consider an adjective like “fast-growing.” If the text says “fast-growing oak,” fast-growing implies a permanent trait (it grows fast habitually) – Cog2p – but it contains a verbal notion growing – Cog2v – describing a process (growth). An annotator might tag “fast-growing” with two labels: Cog2p (as a quality of the oak) and Cog2v (as it literally denotes the action of growing quickly). These two tags form a cluster on the same span “fast-growing.” Another example: “ever-blooming rose” – “ever-blooming” is a quality (always blooms, Cog2p) yet it’s about the process of blooming continuously (Cog2v). An annotator might tag “ever-blooming” with two labels: Cog2p (as a quality of the oak) and Cog2v (as it literally denotes the action of growing quickly). These two tags form a cluster on the same span “fast-growing.” Another example: “ever-blooming rose” – “ever-blooming” is a quality (always blooms, Cog2p) yet it’s about the process of blooming continuously (Cog2v). An annotator might tag “ever-blooming” with two labels: Cog2p (as a quality of the oak) and Cog2v (as it literally denotes the action of growing quickly). These two tags form a cluster on the same span “fast-growing.” - Multiple Properties (Cog2p + Cog2p): A phrase might pack more than one property. For instance, “bright red” – one could tag “bright” and “red” separately as two Cog2p properties of an object, but they form a conceptual cluster describing color intensity together. In practice, you might just tag “bright red” as one span and one Cog2p, or tag “red” Cog2p (color) and possibly “bright” as Cog2p (or as a qualifier of that property). If using clusters, you might tag each and cluster them to indicate they jointly describe the color aspect. However, often one would combine them in a single annotation if they directly modify each other. - Part + Property (Cog3Int + Cog2p): Sometimes an expression includes a part and a property of that part in one go, like “yellow leaves.” You might tag “leaves” as Cog3Int, and “yellow” as Cog2t (transient property) of leaves. This is a straightforward separate tagging (not exactly a cluster, just two tags in relation). But if the phrase is inseparable (like a single compound word meaning a part with a quality), you might cluster. For example, a hypothetical word “redleaf” (if it were a single token describing a type of leaf) – you might need to indicate both part and color. Clustering would attach Cog3Int and Cog2p to the same token. - Object + Reference or Class: Occasionally, a single phrase might function as both a specific object and a generic category in context (this is rarer). Or an object name that encodes a reference (“Jerusalem artichoke” – not likely, but if “Jerusalem” was considered provenance and “artichoke” the object, you’d have a cluster: Cog4 on “Jerusalem” portion and Cog1 on “artichoke” portion; though they’re separate tokens). - Complex analogies: “a lion-like courage” – if one were to annotate “lion-like” in “lion-like courage,” one might tag “lion” as Cog1Ref (reference for analogy) and “-like” as indicating property of courage? This might be an odd case. Possibly cluster Cog1Ref (lion reference) with Cog2p (because the courage has a property “lion-like” i.e., very brave).
How to cluster in practice: Depending on the annotation tool, you might tag overlapping spans or the same span twice with different categories. Not all tools allow exactly the same span to have two labels, but many do (standoff annotation can allow multiple annotations on identical offsets). If not, you might annotate a slightly offset span (like include/exclude a hyphen, etc., to make them “different” spans technically). But conceptually, you want the reader of the annotation to know those two tags pertain to one idea. Sometimes an annotation format can nest one tag inside another – that’s not clustering but embedding. Clustering is more like two tags side by side on same text.
The UI perspective: In a web-based display, clusters might be shown as combined labels or as stacked labels on one phrase. For example, an annotator might see “[fast-growing]_Cog2p,Cog2v” indicating that “fast-growing” has two tags. This is helpful to denote nuance.
Use clusters judiciously: Not every combination needs separate tags. Often, a well-chosen single category suffices. Clustering is for when you’d lose important detail by choosing just one. For instance, you might be tempted to just call “fast-growing” Cog2p and ignore the Cog2v, and that might be fine for many purposes. But if later analysis needs to differentiate descriptive adjectives vs processes, having the Cog2v mark adds value. Clustering solves the ambiguity.
Another example: “newly-emerged leaves”. “Newly-emerged” implies a process/state (they have recently emerged = transient state). You might tag “newly-emerged” as Cog2t (transient, because it indicates current state of having emerged) and perhaps Cog2v (the action of emerging has happened). However, since it's describing leaves now, Cog2t might suffice. Clustering would come if we want to highlight the verb aspect “emerged” as a process.
Edge case – multiple distinct roles: Consider “a queen bee” in a sentence about bees. “Queen bee” is a specific bee which is an individual and also has a role in the colony. We wouldn’t split that; we’d call “queen bee” Cog1 (it’s just one object with a descriptor “queen” which indicates its type among bees, but that’s essentially just part of the noun meaning). That probably wouldn’t be multi-tagged (we don’t do Cog1 + Cog2p there, we treat the whole term as the object’s identity). So not every compound of noun+noun or adj+noun is a cluster scenario – many are just one concept.
Cluster linking: If you have Cog2p and Cog2v on “fast-growing,” how do they link? Likely both link to the object (oak tree). Possibly you’d link the Cog2p to the object with QUALIFIES, and Cog2v to the object with PROCESS_OF. There’s no rule forbidding an object having multiple edges (an object can have many properties, processes linked).
Displaying clusters: This manual itself might not dictate how clusters are shown, but as a note to developers: ensure the system can represent and display multiple annotations on one span. For annotators: be aware you can tag an expression more than once in different ways if needed.
To cluster or not to cluster? If you find yourself wondering whether to assign two categories to one token, consider if separating the roles clarifies the semantics. The goal is not to over-complicate, but to accurately capture meaning. For new annotators: start with single tags per span. Only double-tag if you’re confident both aspects are intended and important. Over-clustering might confuse if not necessary.
Examples: Annotating Simple and Complex Cases
In this section, we’ll walk through several examples, from simple sentences to complex passages, to illustrate best practices, tricky edge cases, and how to apply the Cog categories correctly. Each example will be explained step by step, demonstrating how an annotator would think through the annotation, and showing the final tagged result with reasoning.
Simple Example 1: A Botanical Description
Text: “The tall ⟨Cog1: oak tree⟩ has ⟨Cog2p: deeply rooted⟩ ⟨Cog3Int: roots⟩ and ⟨Cog3Der: acorns⟩.”
Annotated (with references): - oak tree – marked as Cog1 (the object being described). - tall – marked as Cog2p, qualifies “oak tree” (permanent property: being tall is an inherent trait for the oak in context). - roots – marked as Cog3Int, part_of “oak tree”. - deeply rooted – here, “deeply rooted” describes the roots (how the roots are). We could tag “deeply” as part of the phrase modifying roots, or tag “deeply rooted” as a whole. A straightforward way: tag “deeply rooted” as Cog2p as well, linked to “roots”. (Alternatively, “deeply” [adverb] might be included in the property span). Essentially, the oak has roots, and those roots have the quality of being deep. This shows a nested description: “roots” (Cog3Int of oak) in turn has property “deeply rooted” (Cog2p). - acorns – marked as Cog3Der, derived product of the oak (the oak tree produces acorns). We link “acorns” with a DERIVED_FROM or PRODUCT_OF relation to the oak. In the sentence it says “has acorns,” which implies acorns are currently on it (you could argue they are parts when attached). But to demonstrate Cog3Der, we treat acorns as a product the tree has. (Cog3Int vs Cog3Der could be debated; here using Cog3Der highlights acorns as a yield).
The example shows layering: oak tree (Cog1) first, then “tall” attaches to oak, “roots” attaches to oak, “deeply rooted” attaches to roots, “acorns” attaches to oak. Visually, one could draw this:
oak tree (Cog1)
|-- tall (Cog2p) [QUALIFIES oak tree]
|-- roots (Cog3Int) [PART_OF oak tree]
|    \-- deeply rooted (Cog2p) [QUALIFIES roots]
|-- acorns (Cog3Der) [DERIVED_FROM oak tree]
This matches a natural understanding of the sentence.
Edge considerations: If the text was simply “The tall oak has deep roots,” we wouldn’t have Cog3Der at all, just Cog1, Cog2p, Cog3Int. We added acorns to show a product. Also note the use of Cog3Der vs Cog3Int for acorns could depend on context (if it said “with acorns on its branches,” acorns are still attached – one could treat them as part-of at that moment). 
Simple Example 2: A Technical Object
Text: “The ⟨Cog1: clock⟩ contains a ⟨Cog3Int: spring⟩ and ⟨Cog3Int: gears⟩ made of ⟨Cog2p: steel⟩.”
Annotated: - clock – Cog1 (object). - spring – Cog3Int (part of clock). - gears – Cog3Int (parts of clock). Even though plural, we tag “gears” collectively as one Cog3Int entity representing all the gears as components. - made of steel – describes the gears (their material). “steel” is a noun, but it’s functioning as a material descriptor. We can tag “steel” as Cog2p (permanent property: material) linked to “gears”. Alternatively, we could tag “made of steel” as a phrase with Cog2p or just “steel” as Cog2p and know it qualifies the part. - Here we interpret “gears made of steel” as gears having the property of being steel (like steel gears essentially). So yes, “steel” gets Cog2p (material property)[5]. - The phrase structure might result in an annotation cluster or link: “gears (Cog3Int)” – QUALIFIES by “steel (Cog2p)”. Sometimes one might treat “steel gears” as one noun phrase and tag “steel gears” together as Cog3Int if not wanting to separate material. But better to separate to capture that material info.
Relations: - spring PART_OF clock - gears PART_OF clock - steel QUALIFIES gears (as material) No Cog4 or Cog5 here because no location or external agent is mentioned, it’s internal description.
Demonstration: This shows multiple parts (spring, gears) of one object, and a property applied to one of the parts. It also illustrates that not all Cog2p attach only to Cog1 – they can attach to parts too (any object node can have its own properties).
Complex Example 3: Multiple Objects and Interaction
Text (constructed scenario): “In the garden, a ⟨Cog1: tree⟩ with ⟨Cog2p: broad⟩ ⟨Cog3Int: leaves⟩ shades a patch of ⟨Cog1: flowers⟩. The ⟨Cog5: sun⟩ dries the ground around the flowers, but the tree’s presence keeps the air ⟨Cog2t: cool⟩.”
Annotated breakdown: - garden – this is a location context. If the sentence is describing a scene, “in the garden” sets the scene. “garden” could be considered Cog4 (location) if the focus is tree or flowers in it. It’s not phrased as “the tree in the garden” explicitly, but we can infer it modifies the scenario. Likely, we’d tag “garden” as Cog4 relative to the tree or the general scene. Possibly attach “garden” as Cog4 to “tree” (the tree is located in a garden) or to the flowers as well. Either way, garden is location, Cog4. - tree – Cog1 (one main object). - broad leaves – “leaves” = Cog3Int (part of tree); “broad” = Cog2p (permanent property of the leaves, describing their shape/width). So “broad” qualifies “leaves.” - shades – the verb “shades” is the tree casting shade on something. This is an action affecting another object (the flower patch). We tag “shades” as Cog2v (process) associated with the tree (the tree is doing the shading). We will link “shades” as PROCESS_OF tree. Additionally, the action has a target (flowers). We might not have an explicit annotation edge type for target in our scheme; possibly we let the semantic of “shades” imply it. If needed, one could add a note or relation like “AFFECTS flowers”. But focusing on Cog categories: “shades” is a process of the tree (Cog2v). - patch of flowers – we have “flowers” as another object. Are these the focus too? Possibly yes, it’s a second object in scene. We can treat “flowers” as Cog1 as well (since they are independent objects described). Or one could argue the main subject of the whole passage is the tree and its effect; then flowers might be considered Cog5 (an independent object affected by the tree). However, the text does describe something about the flowers (ground around them dries, etc.), which is not just incidental. There’s a slight ambiguity: - If we want to treat both tree and flowers as central, tag both as Cog1. It’s okay to have two Cog1s interacting. - If the focus is supposed to be the tree (like in a text about the tree’s ecosystem), perhaps flowers are more like context objects. But given multiple sentences, it’s like a mini-ecosystem description, so I’d tag both tree and flowers as Cog1 (the passage is describing an interaction, not subordinate one to the other entirely). For demonstration, let’s tag flowers as Cog1 (so we have two Cog1s: tree and flowers). - sun – here “the sun dries the ground”. The sun is a separate entity affecting the scene. It’s not part of tree or flowers, it’s an external actor. So “sun” is Cog5 (independent object affecting others). Alternatively, one might tag sun as Cog1 too, but likely not, because the sun isn’t being described beyond its effect; it’s clearly an external factor. So we choose Cog5 for “sun” relative to either tree or flowers (or whole garden scenario). - dries the ground around the flowers – “dries” is a process verb. What is being dried? “ground around the flowers” – ground could be considered part of location or environment. We didn’t define a direct category for “ground” in relation to flowers. Possibly “ground” could be Cog4 (grounds as location) or Cog5 as an element of environment. We could annotate “ground” as Cog4 relative to flowers. - it’s around the flowers, suggesting location around them, so ground is location context for the flowers – maybe Cog4 for “ground”. That might be stretching Cog4 (as ground is more a thing than a named location, but it is location context). We could annotate “ground” as Cog4 associated with flowers (the environment of the flowers) for consistency, or simply as another object. However, to not overcomplicate, we might leave “ground” untagged; it’s not key to semantic structure beyond indicating context for dryness. For demonstration, we skip tagging “ground” with a Cog category (or if we do, Cog4 or Cog5 could both be argued: Cog4 as location terrain, or Cog5 as an element of environment being affected). - The phrase could be simplified: “sun dries the ground (around flowers)” – main idea is sun (external) causing dryness (transient state) to something in vicinity of flowers. We might simply annotate the effect on flowers indirectly: maybe “dried” state to flowers or soil. But anyway. - the tree’s presence keeps the air cool – this part: “air” – the air is another object (environment component). Similar to ground, air is an entity but here it’s being described as kept cool by tree’s presence. - Air could be tagged as Cog5 (another independent object being affected, like environment factor). Or as Cog4 (air as location? not exactly, it’s more an element). - Let’s say air is Cog5 (an object of environment affected by tree). - cool – describing the air’s state. Cool air is a transient condition (when the tree is present, the air is cooler). So “cool” is Cog2t (transient property) qualifying “air”. This state is caused by the tree’s shade, etc.
Now let’s compile the annotations clearly: - garden – Cog4 (location) linked to tree (the tree is in a garden). - tree – Cog1. - broad – Cog2p (permanent property: broad) linked to leaves. - leaves – Cog3Int (part of tree)[7]. - shades – Cog2v (process) linked to tree (tree shades...). If possible, note that it affects flowers (maybe in annotation, we know the object of the verb is the flower patch). - flowers – Cog1 (another main object). - (We could optionally note “patch of flowers” as a collective, but “flowers” suffices as plural). - sun – Cog5 (independent object affecting others). - dries – Cog2v, presumably linked to sun (sun dries ... process by sun). Or we might link “dries” to ground or flowers (depending on perspective). Actually “sun dries the ground” – subject is sun, so we could say process-of sun (sun doing the drying). But the effect is on ground around flowers. We might not formally link to ground or flowers except via understanding. To keep it simple, we might not annotate “dries” separately here since it’s a transient effect rather than a property of sun. Actually, “dries” is an action by sun, so yes, we can tag it Cog2v attached to sun (Cog5). - air – Cog5 (the air is an object, environment). - cool – Cog2t (transient property) linked to air (air is cool as a result).
Relationships: - garden (Cog4) – PROVENANCE_OF/LOCATION_OF – tree (Cog1). - leaves (Cog3Int) – PART_OF – tree (Cog1). - broad (Cog2p) – QUALIFIES – leaves (Cog3Int). - tree (Cog1) – PROCESS_OF (shades) – presumably itself. Actually, we might phrase it: "shades" as Cog2v is a process of tree. In data, might be tree (Cog1) -> PROCESS_OF -> "shades" (Cog2v). But how to capture object of shade? If needed, a secondary link or note “shades (process) affects flowers”. - sun (Cog5) – (dries) Cog2v process of sun. (Sun -> PROCESS_OF -> dries). And “dries” could implicitly affect ground (Cog4 around flowers). - cool (Cog2t) – QUALIFIES – air (Cog5). - air (Cog5) – could link to location or to tree? Actually, air is not part of tree, just environment influenced. We might not link air to tree except by the narrative. Possibly no direct edge except “tree presence keeps air cool” suggests tree indirectly causing the state – not easily encoded as binary relation in our simple scheme, so we capture by context.
This example demonstrates: - Multiple Cog1 entities (tree, flowers). - A Cog5 entity (sun, air – independent environmental factors). - Process verbs showing interactions (“shades”, “dries”) as Cog2v. - A location context (garden) as Cog4. - Properties and parts as usual (broad leaves, cool air).
Edge case consideration: Could we consider “flowers” as Cog5 (since they’re arguably independent but being affected by tree’s shade)? We chose Cog1 for flowers because we described their scenario as well (sun drying them). If the passage was solely from the tree’s perspective, maybe flowers could be Cog5. It’s a judgment call. In general, if an entity is a significant subject of description on its own (having its own properties or being central in part of text), treat it as Cog1. If it’s mentioned only in relation to the main object, treat as Cog5.
Complex Example 4: A Historical Artifact
Text: “The ⟨Cog1: sword⟩, a medieval blade from ⟨Cog4: Toledo⟩, has a ⟨Cog3Int: hilt⟩ inlaid with gems. It remains ⟨Cog2t: sharp⟩ despite its age. A ⟨Cog5: blacksmith⟩ forged it using ⟨Cog3Der: iron⟩ from local ore.”
Annotations: - sword – Cog1 (object). - medieval – this is describing the sword, indicating its era of origin. You could call that a permanent property (the sword’s origin/time period). Our categories don’t include time explicitly. We might just treat “medieval” as Cog2p (since it’s an inherent classification of the sword’s make era). Alternatively, if it was “15th-century sword,” same idea. We’ll annotate medieval as Cog2p (a descriptive property) of the sword. - blade – here “a medieval blade” is essentially restating the sword (blade is part of a sword normally, but they might be using “blade” as synecdoche for the sword or as apposition). In “The sword, a medieval blade from Toledo,” the phrase between commas describes the sword. We already marked sword as Cog1. “blade” is a noun, but it’s just explaining what the sword is. We don’t need to separately tag blade as a part because it’s basically the sword itself in this context. We can skip tagging “blade” or if we did, we’d say blade is Cog3Int? But that doesn’t make sense because blade is the main part of a sword and often one would tag blade as part if focusing on parts. Here, it’s just a noun in apposition. Best to not double annotate it. - We can consider the phrase “a medieval blade from Toledo” as all describing the sword. So: - medieval (Cog2p, property of sword), - from Toledo (Toledo as Cog4, provenance of sword), - blade (we treat it as just part of that description, not tagging separately). - Toledo – Cog4 (location provenance)[10], indicating the sword is from Toledo (a known historical steel-making city). - hilt – Cog3Int (part of sword). - inlaid with gems – describes the hilt. “with gems” indicates something about the hilt’s decoration. How to annotate? “gems” are objects (stones) embedded in the hilt. Are they parts of the hilt now (since they are inlaid)? Possibly yes, they are components attached. We could tag “gems” as Cog3Int too (parts of hilt). However, the phrasing “inlaid with gems” is more describing a property of the hilt (having gems). One approach: - Tag “gems” as Cog3Int maybe? but they’re not integral like metal; they’re decorative but attached; treat as parts. - It might be easiest to incorporate as: “hilt” (Cog3Int) and annotate “inlaid with gems” as a property of hilt. Maybe create an annotation “gem-inlaid” as Cog2p for the hilt. Or tag “gems” as Cog3Int (part of hilt) and somehow note inlaid (the relation is part_of anyway). For simplicity, we can say: - “gems” – Cog3Int (parts of hilt). - Possibly an additional relation or context that they are embedded, but the fact they are parts covers it: hilt PART_OF sword, gems PART_OF hilt. - We might not create a separate tag for “inlaid” because that’s an action state; we can infer from structure, or we could label “inlaid” as a Cog2t (transient state of the hilt: the hilt is inlaid currently). But being inlaid with gems is not transient in normal sense; it’s a permanent feature of the artifact. So maybe treat “gem-inlaid” as an attribute. Alternatively, skip explicitly tagging “inlaid” as a separate item; the existence of gems as parts implies that. - sharp – Cog2t (transient property) of the sword (the sword remains sharp now, implying maybe it was kept sharp; arguably sharpness could be seen as a transient state because swords can dull or be sharpened over time, it’s not inherent if not maintained). So yes, treat “sharp” as Cog2t (current condition)[5]. If one argued it’s a quality, one might say Cog2p, but since it says “despite its age it remains sharp” – implying normally it would dull but currently it’s sharp – that sounds like a state at present, so Cog2t fits. - blacksmith – a person who forged the sword. The blacksmith is an independent entity in this description (the maker). So “blacksmith” = Cog5 (independent object affecting the sword by creating it). - forged – the verb for what the blacksmith did. “forged [the sword]” is a process. We tag “forged” as Cog2v attached to blacksmith (the blacksmith performed forging). It affected the sword, but we’ll capture that by context (the sword is object of the verb). - iron – “using iron from local ore.” Iron is the material used. The sword presumably is made of iron. “iron” is a product extracted from ore. Within the context of the sword, iron is what the sword is derived from (raw material). We could tag “iron” as Cog3Der relative to the sword: it’s the substance from which the sword is derived (not exactly exudation, but product used). Alternatively, since it says blacksmith forged it using iron, from the blacksmith’s perspective, iron was an input. But better to link to the sword: the sword is derived from iron (we can treat the metal as a derived component). Cog3Der seems appropriate for raw material origin in that sense. - local ore – location/source context for the iron. “from local ore” suggests the iron came from local ore. Possibly: - “ore” itself is a material object, but being used as source. If needed, we could tag “ore” as Cog5 (the object from which iron came) or Cog4 (if “local” just means from local area, ore as location?). Not exactly, ore is a thing. - We might skip tagging ore distinctly unless wanting to capture that relationship. If we did: “ore” Cog5 (since the ore is an object that was acted upon to get iron, independent). - “local” describing ore – likely means ore from the local area, which is a location descriptor. “local” could be Cog4 attached to ore (meaning from local region). This might be too granular for our purposes. We can simply incorporate that the sword’s iron has provenance local. But to demonstrate: - “ore” – Cog5 (an object, raw material source). - “local” – Cog4 (provenance of ore, meaning ore from here). - Iron – we already tag as Cog3Der of sword. Perhaps also relate iron to ore: iron derived from ore (if we had to, but might skip because it's an extra detail). The phrase “iron from local ore” essentially ties provenance to the material: local ore (source place thing). It might suffice to tag “iron” Cog3Der of sword and add a note in text that it's from local ore without separate annotation. To not overcomplicate, we might just keep "local ore" as a phrase indicating where iron came from, without separate Cog tags beyond noting local (as region). Actually, could do: iron Cog3Der (product the sword is made from), and add a note in text that it's from local ore without separate Cog tags beyond that.
Summaries: - sword (Cog1) - medieval (Cog2p) -> sword - Toledo (Cog4) -> sword (place of origin)[10] - hilt (Cog3Int) -> sword - gems (Cog3Int) -> hilt - (implicitly inlaid – captured by presence of gems under hilt) - sharp (Cog2t) -> sword (current state) - blacksmith (Cog5) (person who did something) - forged (Cog2v) -> blacksmith (process by blacksmith) - iron (Cog3Der) -> sword (material it’s derived from) - local (Cog4) -> (iron or ore, indicating origin) - ore (Cog5 or maybe left untagged, since it’s not crucial beyond giving context to iron’s origin)
We see here interplay of many categories: Cog4 is used twice (Toledo for the sword’s origin, local for the ore’s origin), Cog3Int used nested (hilt of sword, gems of hilt), Cog3Der used for material, Cog5 used for an agent (blacksmith) and possibly a source object (ore), Cog2p for a descriptor (medieval), Cog2t for condition (sharp), Cog2v for the forging action.
This example also demonstrates minimality vs completeness: We could annotate every detail (even ore), but we might decide to not tag “ore” since it's only mentioned as part of iron’s provenance. As an annotator, focus on salient things. If “ore” was important (e.g., text discussing mining), then tag it; if it’s just background, you might skip. The principle of minimality suggests we tag enough to capture meaning but not every single noun if it's trivial.
Edge case – person names: If the text said “by John Smith, a blacksmith,” would we tag the name? Possibly not, because identification of a specific individual might not be needed for semantic structural analysis (and the policy said not to research individuals’ accusations etc, but that’s a different point). In annotation, a specific person name like “John Smith” can be Cog5 (he’s an independent agent), or one might leave it untagged if not focusing on named entities. If it said “a blacksmith” as common noun, that we tagged Cog5 as above.
These examples cover a variety of scenarios. In each, we see how the Cog categories are applied and related: - Example 3 showed an ecological interaction scenario with multiple Cog1s and Cog5s. - Example 4 showed a historical artifact with provenance, parts, production, and an agent.
Best practices and edge case tips illustrated: - Always ensure each tag clearly refers to the text’s meaning. If something feels redundant (like tagging “blade” for “sword” in apposition), you can omit it as a separate tag to avoid confusion. - When in doubt between categories (e.g., Cog2p vs Cog2t or Cog3Int vs Cog3Der), consider context: is it inherent vs state? attached part vs produced material? The context usually hints (e.g., “despite its age it remains sharp” signals sharpness is viewed as a maintained state, not a given). - Group related tags logically – e.g., we clustered property with the thing it describes, and part with sub-part. - Use the relations (QUALIFIES, PART_OF, PROCESS_OF, PROVENANCE_OF, etc.) to double-check consistency: every Cog2 should have a QUALIFIES link, every Cog3 a PART_OF link, Cog4 a PROVENANCE/LOCATION link, Cog5 might come in via a verb or just be present (maybe linked by a process as agent or by an affect relation). - If something in the text does not fit any category (like a purely temporal reference “in 1920”), you generally wouldn’t tag it in Cog (since Cog doesn’t handle times explicitly). Focus on objects and their semantic network.
By examining these examples, annotators should gain confidence in identifying the categories and linking them properly, even when faced with sentences that have multiple layers of meaning.
Usage Scenarios for Annotators and Developers
The Cog annotation system is designed to be used collaboratively by content annotators (the subject matter experts or linguists who markup texts) and developers (those integrating the system into software or databases). This section provides guidance tailored to each group to ensure the system is used effectively.
For Annotators: How to Annotate with Cog
If you are an annotator, your job is to read through the text and apply the Cog categories correctly, building up the semantic network of object-centered information. Here is a suggested workflow and some tips:
1. Familiarize Yourself with Categories: Before starting, ensure you have at hand (or in mind) the definitions of all Cog categories (Cog1, Cog1gen, Cog1Ref, Cog2p, Cog2t, Cog2v, Cog3Int, Cog3Der, Cog4, Cog5) – as described earlier. If needed, have a one-page cheat sheet. Pay special attention to categories that could be mixed up (e.g., Cog2p vs Cog2t, Cog3Int vs Cog3Der vs Cog5).
2. Initial Read and Object Identification: Read the text segment fully to grasp its meaning. On a second pass, start highlighting/tagging all objects:
3. Mark every primary entity (proper nouns, common nouns that are subjects or important objects) as Cog1, unless you identify it’s a generic class reference (then Cog1gen) or a reference object (then Cog1Ref).
4. Mark obvious parts of those objects as Cog3Int. If a part is mentioned without the whole explicitly present, you might tag it anyway and later link when the whole is mentioned or if it’s implied.
5. Mark any other noun that doesn’t belong to the main object as possibly Cog5 if it interacts, or Cog4 if it’s location.
6. If the text is list-like, you may have multiple Cog1’s (that’s fine).
7. Essentially, at the end of this step, every noun or noun phrase that represents an entity in the discourse should be considered for a Cog tag (one of the Cog1/3/4/5 categories). You might not tag extremely minor things or generic terms unless relevant.
8. Don’t tag adjectives or verbs yet (except those that are part of names, etc.). Focus on nouns first (the skeleton of the semantic structure).
9. Layer on Properties and Processes: Now, go back to those sentences and tag adjectives, participles, and verbs:
10. For each adjective or descriptive phrase attached to a noun, decide if it’s permanent (Cog2p) or transient (Cog2t) and tag it accordingly. Link it (QUALIFIES) to the noun it describes (which you should have tagged as an object already).
11. For verbs (or verbal nouns) that indicate actions or processes involving the object, tag them as Cog2v. Typically, identify the subject of the verb (which should be an object you tagged). Link the Cog2v to that object (PROCESS_OF). If the object was not tagged because it was implicit or pronoun, ensure it is tagged (you may have to tag pronouns or implicit subjects as the object or realize it refers to a previously tagged object).
12. Some verbs describe what an object undergoes rather than does (passive). You still tag them Cog2v but consider linking to the object that experiences it (for example, “the flowers were cut” – “cut” is a process that happened to flowers; we might attach it to flowers as a transient event in their lifecycle).
13. Tag any adverbial or additional descriptive phrases that modify the process or property if needed (often you can include them in the span of Cog2v or Cog2p tag, e.g., “grows quickly” – you can tag the whole “grows quickly” as one Cog2v phrase, or “quickly” as separate qualifier but it’s fine to include it).
14. Annotate Provenance and Location: Whenever you see a location name or an origin mentioned (including adjectives like “French”, “in the mountains”, “at dawn” – though time is not location, only location/people for Cog4):
15. Tag location names or regional adjectives as Cog4, and link them (PROVENANCE_OF / LOCATION_OF) to the object they pertain to. If the grammar is like “X of Y” or “Y X” (like Persian silk), tag “Persian” Cog4 -> “silk” Cog1.
16. Cultural or group references (e.g., “used by Romans”) – “Romans” can be Cog4 associated with the object or event (the object is in context of Romans). Sometimes you might instead treat “used by Romans” as a Cog5 for Romans affecting the object. But since "Romans" is a people (group origin/association), Cog4 fits (they are associated with its use, arguably). Use context: if it's ownership/history context, Cog4; if they're actively doing something in the scene, Cog5.
17. Annotate Independent Interacting Objects: Identify any entities that are not part of the main object but are involved:
18. E.g., other characters, tools, animals, environmental factors etc. If you haven’t tagged them yet as Cog1 (maybe because they aren’t the focus), tag them as Cog5.
19. Example: “bees pollinate the flower” – if flower is Cog1 focus, “bees” are Cog5.
20. Link any action between them via the verb (the verb you tagged as Cog2v likely attaches to one of them; you might not explicitly connect Cog5 to Cog1 except through that shared verb context).
21. Build the Links (Relations): Now ensure each tag is connected properly:
22. For each Cog2p, Cog2t: draw a QUALIFIES link to the noun it describes.
23. For each Cog2v: draw a PROCESS_OF link to the entity performing or undergoing the process (usually the subject in active voice).
24. For each Cog3Int: draw a PART_OF link to its whole (Cog1 or higher-level Cog3Int). If the text doesn’t explicitly state the whole but you know it, link it logically (e.g., if leaves are mentioned and clearly belong to a previously mentioned tree, link to that tree).
25. For Cog3Der: link it to the source object (DERIVED_FROM relation). If text says “X produces Y” or “Y from X,” Y is Cog3Der of X.
26. For Cog4: link it to the relevant object (PROVENANCE_OF or LOCATED_IN etc.). If ambiguous, like “Greek fire” – Greek is Cog4 for fire.
27. For Cog5: often Cog5 might not need a link except that they appear in a relation via a verb. If you want, you could link Cog5 to Cog1 via a generic relation like “AFFECTS” or “INVOLVED_WITH” if your tool allows custom relations, but it’s not strictly necessary because usually the verb does that connecting job. For clarity, you might not draw a direct line if not sure – it’s okay for Cog5 to exist connected only through context (though some data models might want every node in a connected component – in that case, connect via the verb or create a dummy relation).
28. Check for any unattached tags: if an adjective or part ended up not linked to anything (maybe you forgot to tag its parent), fix that now. Every Cog2, Cog3, Cog4 should have a parent connection. Cog1 and Cog5 are top-level (they might not need a parent, though Cog5 might be involved through processes).
29. If your tool has a validation step, run it (e.g., it might warn if something is orphaned).
30. Use Annotation Clusters when Needed: If you encounter a situation like we discussed in clusters:
31. If one word needs two tags (like a participle that is both descriptive and action-oriented), apply both tags and link appropriately.
32. Ensure that when you cluster, the multiple tags on the same span each fulfill their linking requirements. E.g., “fast-growing”: tagged Cog2p (link to object) and Cog2v (link to object).
33. Keep clusters limited to clear cases; do not overuse overlapping tags because it can make annotation confusing. Only cluster when a single expression genuinely encodes two facets.
34. Minimal vs Comprehensive: The goal is to capture all semantically relevant information without adding interpretation. Do not tag things that are not actually in the text:
35. E.g., if the text says “the plant is healthy”, tag that. If the text implies something (like it hasn’t rained, implying dryness), but doesn’t say it, don’t tag an unstated “dry soil” property unless explicitly mentioned.
36. Don’t guess hidden relations. Stick to descriptives given.
37. At the same time, every significant detail given should be tagged under some category. If the text spends a clause describing something, find a category for it.
38. Ambiguities and Edge Cases: Sometimes you genuinely won’t be sure which category:
39. If a property seems borderline permanent/transient, consider the author’s intent or default assumption (e.g., “old tree” – age could be seen as permanent property, even though age changes, “old” here is a characteristic relative to lifespan). Usually, treat age adjectives as Cog2p (because they describe a stage but as a descriptive trait, unless it’s explicitly temporary like “young this year”).
40. If a part vs product is unclear (fruit example), consider context: If the narrative treats it as attached part of a living thing, Cog3Int; if as a yield/harvest, Cog3Der.
41. When in doubt, annotate with your best guess but be consistent. Maybe leave a comment for reviewers if the tool allows (like “Tagged X as Cog2p though it might be transient in some contexts”).
42. It’s often safer to pick the category that doesn’t presume an outside context. For instance, if text doesn’t indicate time-sensitivity, assume property is inherent.
43. Review Relations for Integrity: After tagging a section, quickly traverse each object:
o	Each Cog1: does it have its properties, parts, provenance properly attached? If it has none of those, that might be fine (maybe nothing said about it). If it has no parts and no properties but text had something, did you miss tagging those?
o	Each Cog3Int: is its PART_OF linked? (No part should float unattached).
o	Each Cog2: is it QUALIFIES/PROCESS_OF something? (No property or process should be unattached).
o	Each Cog4: is it linked to an object? (Location must belong to something).
o	Each Cog5: is it at least mentioned in context with an interaction? (Cog5 might not have a direct link, but check it’s not irrelevant in isolation).
By following this systematic approach, annotators can ensure consistency and avoid missing tags. Over time, this becomes quicker as you internalize the category distinctions.
Also remember the general principles as you annotate: - Minimality: Don’t over-tag. Only annotate what contributes to understanding the object and its context. For example, determiners (“the”, “a”) are not annotated. Repeated mention of the same object? Possibly tag once (the first time) and maybe again if a pronoun refers to it later depending on how the tool works (some do coreference linking instead; Cog doesn’t handle coref explicitly aside from understanding context). - Descriptiveness, not interpretation: Mark exactly what is said. If a sentence says “this remedy is believed to cure headaches” – do we tag a relation “cures” as Cog2v? It’s an action (cure) but it’s speculative (“believed to”). You could tag “cure headaches” as a process and maybe headaches as Cog5 (another object affected) but note the belief context is outside Cog’s simple scheme. Likely, one would tag "cure" as Cog2v of remedy and "headaches" as Cog5 (object affected). But you are not asserting it definitely cures, just capturing the mentioned relationship. That’s fine – as long as you don’t add “effective” or such if not said. If something is metaphorical (“the clouds are sheep”), you might tag “clouds” Cog1, “sheep” as Cog1Ref (metaphor reference). Don’t tag an actual part-of relation that doesn’t exist (cloud doesn’t literally have wool). - User Sovereignty: If guidelines allow some flexibility, and you as annotator sense that tagging something a certain way would impose an interpretation the reader might not share, you can choose a neutral route. For instance, if it’s not clear if something is a property vs a part, you might leave it as whichever is least committal or even not tag if it’s too uncertain. However, in most cases Cog categories are broad enough to cover what is literally there.
By following this systematic approach, annotators and developers should ensure consistent, high-quality annotations that are easy to query and to reuse in analysis. 

General Principles and Best Practices
Before concluding, it’s important to reinforce some general principles that all users of the Cog system should keep in mind. These principles ensure that annotations remain useful, unbiased, and not overly cumbersome.
•	Minimality: Annotate no more than necessary. Each annotation should capture a meaningful piece of information. We do not mark every single word – only those that contribute to the semantic picture of objects and their context. If an object isn’t doing anything or described in any way, you might tag it as Cog1 but then leave it be. Don’t invent properties or tag trivial words. For example, if a sentence reads “The tree is very tall,” we tag “tree” (Cog1) and “tall” (Cog2p). We might tag “very tall” together or “tall” with an intensifier, but we wouldn’t tag “very” separately (it’s just modifying tall, which can be captured in the property’s value). Also, if a description is repeated or obvious from structure, you don’t need duplicate tags. Minimality also applies to not splitting hairs too finely – e.g., if the text says “has a strong unpleasant smell,” you could tag that as two properties (“strong” and “unpleasant”) or one combined (“strong unpleasant smell” as a single Cog2p). Depending on the granularity you need, you might just say “unpleasant smell” is the property, and “strong” an intensifier (maybe include it). Don’t feel obligated to separate every nuance if the analysis doesn’t require it.
•	Descriptiveness, Not Interpretation: Stick to what the text says. Cog annotation is about encoding what is explicitly present in the text (or easily inferred from context). It is not about adding our own explanations or implications. For instance, if a text says “the warrior’s sword is stained with blood,” we annotate “sword” (Cog1), “stained” (Cog2t, a state of the sword), and possibly “blood” as Cog5 (an independent substance on it). We do not add an annotation like “the warrior killed someone” because that is an interpretation beyond the given info. Another example: If a plant is called “sunflower,” we don’t assume we should tag the sun as Cog1Ref or something unless the text explicitly makes a comparison (the name itself is not a simile in the text, it’s just a name). We must be careful especially with historical or literary texts – sometimes metaphors or implications are rich, but we only tag the metaphor as it appears. We do not tag hidden meanings. This keeps the data objective. If later a scholar wants to interpret, they can, but our annotation should provide a neutral scaffold (e.g., tag “blind justice” as Justice (Cog1) + blind (Cog2p) literally as described, not saying “justice is impartial” which is the interpretation).
•	Clarity and Didactic Tone: (particularly for writing the manual or guidelines themselves, but also relevant to annotation results being clear). This manual itself is written to be clear and modular, and that principle extends to the annotations: they should make the text clearer to analyze, not more confusing. If an annotator finds that using Cog categories on a sentence makes it harder to read than the original, maybe something’s off – typically it should dissect the sentence in a sensible way. If not, review if categories were applied correctly.
•	User Sovereignty: This principle implies that the end-user of the annotation (could be a researcher, a student, or even an algorithm consuming the data) has the ability to draw their own conclusions from the annotated data, rather than having the annotator’s biases baked in. In practice:
•	We choose neutral category labels (notice none of the categories impose a value judgment or specific domain assumption; e.g., we didn’t use “dangerous object” as a category – if something is dangerous it would come as a Cog2p “dangerous” perhaps, which is directly from text).
•	If multiple interpretations of a phrase are possible, the annotation should either capture both (if they don’t conflict) or choose the most literal. For example, a line like “the king’s lion” could mean a pet lion or a heraldic symbol. We’d probably tag “lion” as Cog1 (it’s an object mentioned). We wouldn’t try to guess “maybe it’s metaphor, tag Cog1Ref” unless context clearly indicates it. By tagging it just as an object, we leave it to the user to interpret if needed. We don’t, say, tag “lion” as Cog1Ref (reference to courage) unless the text explicitly was a metaphor about courage.
•	Allow the user to query the data in ways they want. For instance, one user might be interested in all Cog4 (locations) to map out where things occur. Another might want all Cog2p to see how objects are described. Because we annotated in a modular way, they can filter that. If we had instead baked everything into a single narrative or left things unstructured, the user would have less flexibility.
•	In terms of tool usage, user sovereignty also means an annotator can override or adjust tags if context demands, not being forced by a rigid system to mis-tag. (For instance, if a tool tried to enforce that every verb must be Cog2v, but maybe a verb is just a copula or helper, you wouldn’t tag it – the annotator should have control).
•	Consistency: Not explicitly in the question text, but a best practice principle: annotate similar texts in similar ways. If two annotators work on this, they should follow the same guidelines. That’s why clear definitions and examples are provided. Consistency ensures that the output is reliable. A developer might enforce consistency by verifying patterns (like if one person marked all plant colors as Cog2p and another as Cog2t in similar scenarios, that’s an inconsistency to resolve). Regular team check-ins or using these examples as reference can help.
•	Documentation and Updates: As with any annotation system, continually update guidelines with new tricky examples. This manual is modular, meaning each section can be read on its own (categories, layering, etc.). For developers, ensure any changes in schema are reflected in tooltips or documentation in the software. For annotators, if they discover a type of phrase not covered, they should consult project leads to decide how to tag and then add that to guidelines for future.
By adhering to these principles – minimality in what we tag, fidelity to the text’s content, and giving users the means to understand the text through these annotations without forcing an interpretation – the Cog annotation system will produce data that is both rich in information and trustworthy for analysis. The end result is a structured semantic representation that remains as close as possible to the original text, simply reorganized in an object-centric way.
Through examples and guidelines above, both new annotators and experienced developers can align their approach for consistent results. As you deploy this system in a web-based resource or any platform, remember that clarity for the end-user is paramount. The annotated data should ultimately help someone navigate the text’s content – whether that’s a reader hovering over a word to see its tag, or a scholar querying a database of these annotations.
By tagging what is actually there in the text and structuring it around objects, the Cog system turns unstructured text into a network of knowledge that is both human-readable and machine-tractable. We hope this manual serves as a helpful guide as you annotate and develop with object-centered semantics in mind.
